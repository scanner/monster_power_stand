monster_power_stand
===================

A stand-off for monster power outlets to-go when used with a 2-prong to 3-prong converter

The monster power outlets togo is a travel power strip + usb charger.

This is a fine device. However if you need to use this with a 2-prong to 3-prong adapter it becomes a bit unstable and you need a stand to hold it off from the wall or table it is plugged in to.

This simple 3d object serves that purpose.
